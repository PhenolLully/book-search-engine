# 21 MERN: Book Search Engine

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
My motivation was to complete the implementation of Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries.
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
 I built this project to utilize and hopefully show that I understand the use of Apollo server and GraphQL
- What problem does it solve?
It solves the problem of setting up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.
- What did you learn?
I learned that I did have trouble implementing render by myself on my second go around but I also learned that Apollo Server and GraphQL are very useful!
## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

First a github repository needs to be created make sure it has a README.md file, then clone the repository and paste it in your Week 4 folder. Then open the developer folder in the class repository and copy the material inside the folder into the repository folder. Then you can continue work on the assignment.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

  ![](./assets/images/)
